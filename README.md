# Fast-Panorama-Stitching-for-High-Quality-Panoramic-Images-on-Mobile-Phones
This project implements an algorithm that takes a set of images and the overlap between each pair of images as input and stitches these images together to obtain a panoramic image.
The algorithm also tries to ensure that it is efficient in terms of both memory and  time complexity so that it can be run on a mobile, while maintaining the quality of the output stitched image. 

The results directory contains the input images and the output images for various panorama images.

## How To Run
```
python3 Source.py
